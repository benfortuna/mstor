 mstor - Release Notes
=======================

 mstor is a local store provider for JavaMail. mstor builds on the mbox format and
 provides the following benefits:

 * implemented using Java "New I/O" (java.nio.*) to (theoretically) provide better
 performance
 
 * uses the mbox format for storing messages
 
 * incorporates a "metafile" for each mbox folder to store additional metadata for
 messages (and alleviate the need to modify the mbox file)
 
 * provides basic caching configuration to allow control over the performance vs.
 memory usage equation
 
 * better performance for large mailboxes

 Detailed descriptions of changes included in each release may be found
 in the CHANGELOG.


====================
 Mbox File Encoding
====================

 The mbox format is essentially a concatenation of RFC822 messages with an
 additional "From_" line inserted at the start of each message. Instances of
 "From_" within the message body are also escaped with a preceding ">" character.
 
 Because mbox is just RFC822 messages, file encoding should always be "US-ASCII".
 
 Although mstor doesn't encode/decode message content (it is assumed appended
 messages are valid RFC822 messages), we still need to use an encoding to
 interpret message headers and create the "From_" line, for which "US-ASCII" is
 used.
 
 It is possible however, to override the mbox file encoding used by specifying the
 following system property:
 
     -Dmstor.mbox.encoding=<some_encoding>
