=======================

mstor is a local store provider for JavaMail. mstor builds on the mbox format and provides the following benefits:

 * uses the mbox format for storing messages
 
 * incorporates a "metafile" for each mbox folder to store additional metadata for messages (and alleviate the need to modify the mbox file)
 
 * provides basic caching configuration to allow control over the performance vs. memory usage equation
 
 * better performance for large mailboxes
