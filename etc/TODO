 To-do List
============

 NOTE: system properties should be
 added to allow suppression of metadata and dual
 folder content support. This is to allow for direct

 implementations.

 caching and smart loading of message content
 
 - Save headers to metadata to facilitate access to message
 information without loading entire message
