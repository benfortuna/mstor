 mstor - Changes
=================


0.9.3:

 - Added validation of mbox files to MStorFolder.list()
 
 - Support for headers in metadata. This has some implications:
 
 	* metadata is no longer created for existing mailboxes if it
 	doesn't already exist
 	
 	* if metadata exists, headers are read from metadata (only
 	a problem for mailboxes created prior to this change)
 

0.9.2_01:

 - Recompiled with JDK 1.4.2 for compatibility with pre-1.5 JVM


0.9.2:

 - Added patches to MboxFile.purge() and MstorFolder.expunge()
 to work on Unix/Linux - provided by Paul Legato
 
 - Added fix to mask/unmask patterns in message content that
 match the "From_" line pattern - provided by Michael G. Kaiser
 
 - From_ line now specifies date message is appended to the
 mbox file (rather than "1 Jan 1970")
 
 - Added support for folders that hold both messages and subfolders
 
 
0.9.1:

 - Improved meta-data implementation
 
 
0.9:

 - Initial Release
 
 - Reading from/appending to mbox files
 
 - Basic message caching
