 mstor - Changes
=================


0.9.3:

 - Added validation of mbox files to MStorFolder.list()
 
 - Support for headers in metadata. This has some implications:
 
 	* metadata is only created for existing mailboxes if its
 	contents are changed (i.e. headers, flags, etc.)
 	
 	* if metadata exists, headers are read from metadata in an
 	attempt to delay loading of the entire message
 	
 	* all headers are currently save which means the metadata
 	file can get quite large. Will review this at a later date
 	
 - metadata reworked to use message number as identifier as opposed
 to message id. This means that:
 
    * the message content no longer requires loading to get the
    message id and obtain the metadata (sort of defeated the purpose
    previously..)
 
    * non-MIME messages can now save metadata (MIME messages don't
    have a message id)
    
    * when messages are expunged other messages' metadata must have their
    message numbers updated to stay in synch with the folder
 
 - Added error handling to MboxFile to "fall back" on using a random access
 file where java.nio fails. This seems to occur on Windows 98 consistently.
 

0.9.2_01:

 - Recompiled with JDK 1.4.2 for compatibility with pre-1.5 JVM


0.9.2:

 - Added patches to MboxFile.purge() and MstorFolder.expunge()
 to work on Unix/Linux - provided by Paul Legato
 
 - Added fix to mask/unmask patterns in message content that
 match the "From_" line pattern - provided by Michael G. Kaiser
 
 - From_ line now specifies date message is appended to the
 mbox file (rather than "1 Jan 1970")
 
 - Added support for folders that hold both messages and subfolders
 
 
0.9.1:

 - Improved meta-data implementation
 
 
0.9:

 - Initial Release
 
 - Reading from/appending to mbox files
 
 - Basic message caching
